And don't forget to have fun. One false start, one poorly timed deployment, and you could be raptured and taken back to your creator, before you could even throw one of those your catchy sexy emote. Your goal is not just to fall aimlessly from the sky, but you have to strategically calculate your plummit as it is a complex science of physics, geometry, and psychology, all of which must be factored in to make a quick fire strategic calculation. So, if you have never payed attention in any of your math, physics or geography classes better start private classes with your teachers.<br></div>

In case you for gotten, your parachute deploys automatically once your character reaches a certain programmed distance from the ground or any solid surface object which includes trees, buildings and hills. This would mean that a player will be forced to deploy his parachute if he/she skydives above a mountain, tree, or building. But someone who skydives above a ravine, which will cause their parachute to be deployed at a latter time.</p><p>So anyone who targets to getting to the floor as fast as possible, avoid any high rise obstacles. but for those who plan to land onn a mountain top should still aim for a low terrain area then work his way to the top of the hill.</p></div>

Land close to Weapons&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The faster you get to the ground in Fortnite, the faster you can grab a weapon. In later times we will discuss about the best weapons you can keep in your inventory to determine an aggressive gameplay. Now you cannot make it through the game with a pickaxe even if your a pro - pickaxes no matter the variety has a damage point of 10 no matter where it lands (head, arm, leg), you may succeed in killing your first victim but another person can use a sniper rifle to your head just as soon as you make your first kill. Whenever you try to land make sure you head for the ground weapons made available through out the map and if you plan to land on the roof top of building keep your eyes peeled for weapons. Even if its a common pistol atleast you can defend yourself from enemies at the start of the game giving you room to find a better weapon.</p><p>Chests are also an option, but are less ideal than a floor weapon - chests are just like betting, you never know what it will spawn next! you may open one and have a bandage, minie, or bullets whereby your enemy is already equipped with a weapon. The first thirty seconds in any busy landing spot always entails a mad dash for weaponry, so if you do manage to grab a firearm as soon as you've hit the floor, you'll have the perfect opportunity to take out any unarmed scrabblers while they're still vulnerable.</p></div>

Comparing better landing spots to the others</strong><br><strong><br></strong>&nbsp;As for where you want to land in Fortnite, that's where things start to get... a whole lot subjective. Naturally, everyone will have their favourite spots of landing, some, shifty shafts, greasy groove, loot lake, tilted towers, haunted hills, rift valley a whole lot more let me not mention the entire map, but let us speak in terms of pure competitiveness - areas with high or low opponent competitive level - some locales are basically better landing choices to others. Tilted towers in my personal point of view, which many will agree on although fun, but is basically like playing unchanted as a beginner in the mist of pros! Meaning that your choices of survival are drastically reduced as soon as you are in the game.</p>

Such places are Lucky Landing, Risky Reels, or Anarchy Acres. <strong>Caution </strong>you don't need to land at a named location to get plenty loot; the North East corner of the map, for instance, has dozens of potential chests scattered around its various structures, but the amount of people dropping alongside you is usually nice and minimal.</div>

Out of 99 other Fortnite players you'll be competing against each other match, only a few baker's dozen will typically have the willpower to glide all the way to lets say haunted hill when the battle bus comes from Greasy Grove to Wailing Woods, <strong>NOTE </strong>am not asking that you dive all the way to Haunted Hills just an instance, besides it is advisable to get into fights frequently to become a great player. So it will be good to land away from the path of the Battle Bus' randomly designated route.&nbsp;<br><br>So if you're a Fortnite player who likes to start of the game in a low key then you have to plan to deploy your parachute almost straight away to reach a more receded destination. It might mean spending more time in the sky, but lack of enemy opposition at the early times of the game is worth it if you have to start off in low key and build your way to fights as the storm closes in.</p>

Many people feel that weapon rarity has the same effect on gliders and harvesting tools. <strong>They don't have such effect! </strong>They're only cosmetic, some may come with some boast distinct sound effects that might provide cues for who's nearby which will be helpful in certain situations. Umbrellas and gliders are therefore completely the same, as harvesting tools are completely the same - harvesting wood, bricks and iron are not faster - they all have the same harvest speed so does the gliders and umbrellas have the same speed.</p><p>There is no secret life hacks to falling faster so do not think of such things - all you have to do is aim your camera straight down, of course - Epic Games make sure that all wrinkles are ironed out so that no one feels cheated, the game remains balanced through out the game play. So ignore the myth makers; it's hard, cold, painful facts that'll pave your way to a solid landing in Fortnite leading to Victory Royale.</p></div>
